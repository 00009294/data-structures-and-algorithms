# Trees
>## *Tree* - non-linear data structure that represents hierarchy structure
>## Top most node in hierarchy is *root* node
>## Previous node to particular node is a *parent* node(one upper level node)
>## Immediate successor is a *child* node(one lower level node)
>## *Leaf Node* is a node that has no child node(or external node)
>## *Non Leaf Node* is a node that has child node
>## *Edge* is length between two nodes
>## *Ancestor* is any node that is in upper level, connected by a path upwards from specific node till root 
>## *Descendant* is any node that is in lower level, connected by a path downwards from specific node till leaf node
